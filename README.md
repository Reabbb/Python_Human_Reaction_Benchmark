# Python_Human_Reaction_Benchmark

https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime Website to check reaction time 

When it detects the color green and says "Go," it automatically left clicks it for you. I assure you, you can get some unhuman levels of reaction clicks. I'm not sure why I made this, but... enjoy, I guess. Note this works better with good ping.

Make sure you have the required installments with pip cv2, numpy, pyautogui, and etc look at the imports in the python code for full required installments.
